    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Thousands of emergency calls are made in America every year. Many of these
      calls end up in tragedy, as many emergency vehicles don't make it to their
      destination on time. Friendly Flyers is an organization made to help those
      who are waiting for medical or mental help, and save more lives.
    </p>
    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>
      Friendly Fliers are controlled and monitored by real people. After calling
      for a Friendly Flier on the home page and specifying the desired
      assistance, a Flier from a local station will be sent to the scene. A care
      package consisting of first aid supplies, or any other neccesary equipment
      will arrive. In the event that the flier has no method of entry to a
      building, and the person in need of assistance is unable to let it in, it
      will carefully remove a portion of the window glass to let itself in. When
      the drone arrives to the person in need, the dispatcher controlling the
      flier will monitor the situation, talk them through what to do, and keep
      them company until help arrives.

    <h1>Job Offers</h1>
    <p>
      The drones sometimes need testing and fixing so we employ people to fix
      them. We also need professional drone flyers to fly and operate the drone
      towards the scene.
    </p>
    <h1>Payments</h1>

    <p>
      The cost is $10 a month if you have paid subscription, and a one-time
      payment of $15 if you have no paid subscription.
